            <p>
                This page gives a brief overview of who I am as a student and developer.
                I am currently learning Go as part of my CMPS 360 course, and this website
                is a project to practice building and deploying a simple web application.

                The goal of this assignment is not only to create multiple pages, but
                also to understand how a backend language like Go can serve HTML, CSS,
                and images together to build a complete website.
