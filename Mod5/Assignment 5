For this assignment, you will develop a C# website following the approach we used in class. Ensure that you complete all the requirements below:

Navigation Bar Update:

Create five header links at the top of the website.
Replace the two custom headers that are currently in place with new ones.
About Page:

Add an About page that provides details about the application you're developing.
Include relevant content and at least one image to enhance the page.
Backend Logic Implementation:

On two different pages, implement backend logic using conditional statements.
The logic should dynamically output data to the front end based on conditions, similar to what we did in class.
Version Control:

Check in your completed code to a GitHub repository.
Presentation:

Be prepared to present your project remotely in a video (youTube, Vimeo etc;)
