Assignment Title: Developing a Basic Spring Boot RESTful Application
Objective
By the end of this assignment, students will:

Understand how to set up a Spring Boot project using Maven.
Create a basic RESTful API with Spring Boot.
Resolve potential issues during development, such as dependency configuration or execution errors.
Task Description
Scenario
You have been hired by a startup company to develop a simple Spring Boot application that acts as a RESTful API to display messages. The company does not require a database connection at this stage. Your task is to create an application with endpoints that return the following:

A welcome message (e.g., Welcome to Spring Boot!).
A dynamic message where the user can pass their name as a query parameter (e.g., Hello, [name]!).
Requirements
Project Setup:

Use Maven to set up the project.
Add the necessary dependencies for a Spring Boot web application (spring-boot-starter-web).
Ensure the application is runnable using mvn spring-boot:run.
Endpoints:

Create a GET endpoint /welcome that returns a static welcome message.
Create a GET endpoint /greet that accepts a query parameter name and returns a personalized greeting. If the name is not provided, return a default message.
Examples:

/welcome → Response: "Welcome to Spring Boot!"
/greet?name=Alice → Response: "Hello, Alice!"
/greet → Response: "Hello, Guest!"
Error Handling:

Handle invalid requests gracefully using appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request for missing required parameters).
Documentation:

Create a README.md file with instructions on:
How to run the application.
Sample requests and responses.
Instructions
Step 1: Create the Project

Use Spring InitializrLinks to an external site. or manually set up the Maven pom.xml.
Ensure the project runs without errors.
Step 2: Implement the Application

Write the main application class with @SpringBootApplication.
Create a controller class (e.g., HelloController) with the required endpoints.
Step 4: Submit Your Work

Include all source files in GitHub
Provide the README.md with the instructions.
Include screenshots of successful requests and responses for both endpoints.
Evaluation Criteria
Criteria	Points
Proper Maven Project Setup	10
Functionality of /welcome	10
Functionality of /greet	15
Error Handling	10
Code Clarity (readability, comments)	5
Documentation (README.md)	10
Testing (Screenshots & Results)	10
Hints and Tips
Use @RestController to create RESTful endpoints.
Use @RequestParam to capture query parameters in the /greet endpoint.
If you encounter the zsh: command not found: mvn error, ensure Maven is properly installed and added to your PATH.
